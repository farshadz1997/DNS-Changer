# DNS Changer 

I wrote this script to make DNS changing faster.

## Usage

Run it as administrator and type your connection name and choose one of providers.\
The one with "Ethernet" suffix is for Ethernet adaptor connection and you can't choose the connection with this.\
You can find the EXE file in EXE folder.\
To use GUI DNS changer first extract it from EXE folder and run the program as administrator then edit json file for adding dns or add them through program.
