# DNS Changer 

I wrote this script to make DNS changing faster.

## Usage

Run it as administrator and type your connection name and choose one of providers.\
The one with "Ethernet" suffix is for Ethernet adaptor connection and you can't choose the connection with this.\
You can find the EXE file in EXE folder.\
To use GUI DNS changer first install the package below with pip and run the program as administrator.\
You can either edit the json file with program or inside the file.
```bash
pip install psutil
```
